# SI-507-Final-Proj

## Overview
This project is a tour guide system that utilizes data from Reddit (https://www.reddit.com ) to provide information about Michigan university subreddits. The system provides an interactive command line interface for users to retrieve and explore data related to university subreddits. The data is presented in the form of a data frame, line chart, and summary information such as recent posts, top posts, and most commonly used words in post titles or text. The system also offers options to save the data and combine it with previously scraped data.
