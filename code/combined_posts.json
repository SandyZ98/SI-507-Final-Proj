Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

I WOULD have been in the union any other monday but last night I wasn\u2019t, nothing bad happened.  So why am I so upset?  Why am I taking this so hard? I\u2019m fine. Literally perfectly unharmed.  Yet here I am, barely functioning. I feel this overwhelming guilt that I\u2019m acting like this when there are kids who WERE traumatized, hurt, and killed.  I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying all of this, I just think I needed to get it out to people who might understand.  Every moment I\u2019m not crying or shut down, I\u2019m guilty for not grieving for my community.  Every time I am grieving for those lost, I feel guilty because I never even knew them.  When I get those weird intrusive thoughts of me getting hurt in the Union, I feel guilty because I was lucky that I never got hurt.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a.

Hope this helps!\n\nPrior to Going Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Have a fully charged phone\n\ud83d\udd39Apps: Download and set up Uber and Venmo. Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes. Most of the clothes I have are the same since freshmen year. I just don\u2019t know how to \u201cfind my people\u201d when everyone I see is white and rich.

I see a lot of people talk about both on this subreddit and in general that the Michigan community is strong and everyone can find their group. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC. I can whole heartedly say that, as a whole, the ICC community (at least central campus co-ops) consist of the most homogenous, racist, and unwelcoming people I\u2019ve met. Yes, they\u2019re very accepting in lots of different ways\u2026but certainly not race. I also was stunned at the amount of rich co-opers.

Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45.

I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here.

Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue.

Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year.

We got them already and they are in my freezer (aka my porch, the Michigan freezer)\n\nQ: Does this have to do with the avian flu??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Have they been poisoned??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Where can I see the crows roost/fly in to roost?\n\nA: They roost in different spots every year. This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year. And DEFINITELY don't do this if you have outdoor poultry of any kind.

I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)", "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on.

How dare a private company force you to not have the ability to safely park within the campus lots because you can\u2019t pay for their extra fees even though you already paid for the tuition and fees from EMU. How dare EMU let this injustice occur and allow a private company to divide its student body into 2nd and 3rd class citizens.\n\nThe main people who are oppressing you during this whole situation are the parkEMU attendants. These grown men are not part of EMU and have no affiliation with the school other than their employers cheekily named them parkEMU.

We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor.

In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.\n\nWhat many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear. As they say on airplanes, \u201cput on your own oxygen mask before attempting to assist others.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d love for this thread to remain a place for Spartans to talk through their emotions, share social emotional wellness resources, or to just listen. Whatever you need, remember - your are cared for, your are loved, and you are safe.\n\nI\u2019m here if anyone needs anything, and knowing our other mods - they\u2019re likely here for you as well, in whatever capacity they can.\n\n\\-Chris\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Crisis resources being offered via phone, or in person.](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/11220w9/crisis_resources/) \\-u/mrsjonas\n* [Previous megathread with traditional campus resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/j2zyj0/feeling_down_here_are_some_resources/)\n* [Mindfulness meditation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/mindfulness-meditation-to-control-pain)\\- Harvard Health\n* [Controlled breathing techniques](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response) \\- Harvard Health\n* [Take a walk across the sites of MSU](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1128h2a/event214_200_pm_400pm_take_the_garden_walk_wave/)", "https://www.wlns.com/news/local-news/how-many-more-simple-question-on-the-rock-at-msu-packs-a-punch/amp/\n\nLove a 2018 Spartan.", "", "", "We are sending you guys prayers here from Penn State University.

I wanted to hear from students who shared my experience, who sat through what I sat through, who feel the fear and pain I feel.

More random screaming as the night progressed. \n\nFrom the window I could see a lot of police and other special forces, as Landon was a staging area last night.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a.

Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Going into my fourth year now, though, I can\u2019t help but see how one-sided this community is. The umich community is extremely homogenous and unwelcoming of minorities and low income students. \n\nAs someone who grew up in a very diverse community and went to a majority-minority high school, first coming to umich in 2019 was a shock. I\u2019m biracial, but white-passing, and the lack of diversity of this school is demoralizing. I was never used to seeing a sea of white people every day like this. Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes. Most of the clothes I have are the same since freshmen year. I just don\u2019t know how to \u201cfind my people\u201d when everyone I see is white and rich. Yes, there are plenty of people who don\u2019t fit this box, but I just haven\u2019t been able to meet them.\n\nI only have one semester left, so I\u2019m not writing this in hopes of finding a community or anything, but rather to share my experience from these past years. I see a lot of people talk about both on this subreddit and in general that the Michigan community is strong and everyone can find their group. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC. I can whole heartedly say that, as a whole, the ICC community (at least central campus co-ops) consist of the most homogenous, racist, and unwelcoming people I\u2019ve met. Yes, they\u2019re very accepting in lots of different ways\u2026but certainly not race. I also was stunned at the amount of rich co-opers. For a community that\u2019s really meant to help low income students, it (like everything else at UM) has been taken over by high income folks.

There were exams scheduled\tfor 8 am that have thousands of students. The bus was still far from enough. I personally woke up at 6:30 and got to the bus stop at 6:40 today. Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45. I arrived at Lorch 10 minutes late to my exam and had to take the exam with an empty stomach (I was planning to get my sugar from the vending machine but I didn\u2019t have the time now).\n\nI could have been more aggressive and pushed myself through the people fighting to get on the bus and got to Lorch earlier, but is that what it came down to? Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus. It was not because I was lazy and woke up late, but because I didn\u2019t want to push other students away to get on the bus and potentially make them late to their exam. \n\nWe need more buses in the morning.

Yesterday I found three dead crows under the same tree off Washtenaw Court. This is pretty sus because:\n\n\\-it's the wrong time of year for West Nile (a disease transmitted only by mosquitoes)\n\n\\-all three were found together, likely from the large Ann Arbor murder\n\n\\-two of the three were seemingly quite healthy (good healthy chunky keel, glossy feathers, bright eyes). the third was probably also healthy but it had been scavenged by the time we found it so we couldn't tell.\n\nThe two birds we collected are being sent out for bird flu testing as well as toxicology testing. We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one!

This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year. And DEFINITELY don't do this if you have outdoor poultry of any kind.

I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)", "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on.

That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.\n\nWhat many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

I was told this wasn\u2019t supported as it wasn\u2019t prepared in a licensed kitchen. I brought my stuff anyways hoping I could donate it or something. Well, all of those plans fell through because once I made it to campus, I realized grilling hot dogs just didn\u2019t seem like the right move at all. \n\nWith that said, would any of you want to see a guy grilling up some free dogs for you all until campus shuts me down? If not, I get it, and I\u2019ll figure out what to do with the food. If yes, where would you want to see me that\u2019s less likely to draw attention and maximize my dawg slinging capabilities.\n\nI really hope you are all doing as well as you possibly can be during this difficult time.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a.

Hope this helps!\n\nPrior to Going Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Have a fully charged phone\n\ud83d\udd39Apps: Download and set up Uber and Venmo. Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile.

I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC.

There were exams scheduled\tfor 8 am that have thousands of students. The bus was still far from enough. I personally woke up at 6:30 and got to the bus stop at 6:40 today. Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45.

Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus.

We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one!

This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year.

I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.

We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor.

In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.\n\nWhat many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success.

In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a.

Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

It is not enough to accommodate all the students who have to get to central for class from the start.\n\nClass is one thing, exam is another whole different story. There were exams scheduled\tfor 8 am that have thousands of students. The bus was still far from enough. I personally woke up at 6:30 and got to the bus stop at 6:40 today. Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45. I arrived at Lorch 10 minutes late to my exam and had to take the exam with an empty stomach (I was planning to get my sugar from the vending machine but I didn\u2019t have the time now).\n\nI could have been more aggressive and pushed myself through the people fighting to get on the bus and got to Lorch earlier, but is that what it came down to? Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus. It was not because I was lazy and woke up late, but because I didn\u2019t want to push other students away to get on the bus and potentially make them late to their exam. \n\nWe need more buses in the morning.

Yesterday I found three dead crows under the same tree off Washtenaw Court. This is pretty sus because:\n\n\\-it's the wrong time of year for West Nile (a disease transmitted only by mosquitoes)\n\n\\-all three were found together, likely from the large Ann Arbor murder\n\n\\-two of the three were seemingly quite healthy (good healthy chunky keel, glossy feathers, bright eyes). the third was probably also healthy but it had been scavenged by the time we found it so we couldn't tell.\n\nThe two birds we collected are being sent out for bird flu testing as well as toxicology testing. We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one! The plot thickens. Or maybe it doesn't and I am just overreacting!\n\nEDIT: Jfc my inbox is blowing up lol. Sorry if i don't get to your questions I probably missed them cuz i have like fifty notifications!\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I found dead crows near Washtenaw Court and Geddes yesterday!\n\nA: Yes, thanks! We got them already and they are in my freezer (aka my porch, the Michigan freezer)\n\nQ: Does this have to do with the avian flu??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Have they been poisoned??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Where can I see the crows roost/fly in to roost?\n\nA: They roost in different spots every year. This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year. And DEFINITELY don't do this if you have outdoor poultry of any kind.

I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.

In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.\n\nWhat many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear. As they say on airplanes, \u201cput on your own oxygen mask before attempting to assist others.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d love for this thread to remain a place for Spartans to talk through their emotions, share social emotional wellness resources, or to just listen.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Going into my fourth year now, though, I can\u2019t help but see how one-sided this community is. The umich community is extremely homogenous and unwelcoming of minorities and low income students. \n\nAs someone who grew up in a very diverse community and went to a majority-minority high school, first coming to umich in 2019 was a shock. I\u2019m biracial, but white-passing, and the lack of diversity of this school is demoralizing. I was never used to seeing a sea of white people every day like this. Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes. Most of the clothes I have are the same since freshmen year. I just don\u2019t know how to \u201cfind my people\u201d when everyone I see is white and rich.

I see a lot of people talk about both on this subreddit and in general that the Michigan community is strong and everyone can find their group. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC. I can whole heartedly say that, as a whole, the ICC community (at least central campus co-ops) consist of the most homogenous, racist, and unwelcoming people I\u2019ve met. Yes, they\u2019re very accepting in lots of different ways\u2026but certainly not race. I also was stunned at the amount of rich co-opers. For a community that\u2019s really meant to help low income students, it (like everything else at UM) has been taken over by high income folks.

There were exams scheduled\tfor 8 am that have thousands of students. The bus was still far from enough. I personally woke up at 6:30 and got to the bus stop at 6:40 today. Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45.

Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus. It was not because I was lazy and woke up late, but because I didn\u2019t want to push other students away to get on the bus and potentially make them late to their exam. \n\nWe need more buses in the morning.

We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one!

This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year.

I can see why nobody sits out there, I don't want to either.

ScrewU parkEMU.", "Can anyone give me a legitimate reason why the parking is $200 for 1 semester? Has the School given any reason why it went up $20 from last semester?

I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)", "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on.

We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor. Such a case of  Tragedy of the Commons.\n\n Is this what I have to look forward to, when working on group projects at EMU with other students? \n\nLearned incompetence has not skipped generations,

Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

Please clean up after yourselves.\n\nTLDR: If the confetti/glitter ends up in sewers (which it almost certainly does), it ends up in the Huron River and creates microplastics that never dissipate\n\nThere are significant reasons why this shouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue:\n1. It\u2019s selfish to assume that someone else will clean it up\n1a. Facilities & Operations have better uses for their time and shouldn't have to clean up after entitled children\n2. It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a. THINK OF THE SQUIRRELS, our beloved friends may not be around much longer if they snack on confetti\n5. There are legitimate biodegradable alternatives that don\u2019t leave metal-coated plastic everywhere on the quad \n\nDoes anyone know who we could contact with the University to try and get some limits on the confetti/glitter?\n\nIf you want to read more about this, here are a few useful links:\nhttps://brightly.eco/blog/eco-friendly-confetti\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/from-fish-to-humans-a-microplastic-invasion-may-be-taking-a-toll/\n\nIt's absurd that they don't clean up after their photoshoots.

I made a lil guide of things I wished I knew before going to my first frat party. Hope this helps!\n\nPrior to Going Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Have a fully charged phone\n\ud83d\udd39Apps: Download and set up Uber and Venmo. Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes. Most of the clothes I have are the same since freshmen year. I just don\u2019t know how to \u201cfind my people\u201d when everyone I see is white and rich.

I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC. I can whole heartedly say that, as a whole, the ICC community (at least central campus co-ops) consist of the most homogenous, racist, and unwelcoming people I\u2019ve met. Yes, they\u2019re very accepting in lots of different ways\u2026but certainly not race. I also was stunned at the amount of rich co-opers.

In the morning (7-8am) there are only two buses going around and the interval of time is roughly 15 minutes. It is not enough to accommodate all the students who have to get to central for class from the start.\n\nClass is one thing, exam is another whole different story. There were exams scheduled\tfor 8 am that have thousands of students. The bus was still far from enough. I personally woke up at 6:30 and got to the bus stop at 6:40 today. Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45. I arrived at Lorch 10 minutes late to my exam and had to take the exam with an empty stomach (I was planning to get my sugar from the vending machine but I didn\u2019t have the time now).\n\nI could have been more aggressive and pushed myself through the people fighting to get on the bus and got to Lorch earlier, but is that what it came down to? Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus. It was not because I was lazy and woke up late, but because I didn\u2019t want to push other students away to get on the bus and potentially make them late to their exam. \n\nWe need more buses in the morning. Umich has the money to do it, the buses to do it, figure it out.\n\n[Edit]\n\nI\u2019m planning to take this very seriously and planning to do everthing a student can do to get this fixed.

Yesterday I found three dead crows under the same tree off Washtenaw Court. This is pretty sus because:\n\n\\-it's the wrong time of year for West Nile (a disease transmitted only by mosquitoes)\n\n\\-all three were found together, likely from the large Ann Arbor murder\n\n\\-two of the three were seemingly quite healthy (good healthy chunky keel, glossy feathers, bright eyes). the third was probably also healthy but it had been scavenged by the time we found it so we couldn't tell.\n\nThe two birds we collected are being sent out for bird flu testing as well as toxicology testing. We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one! The plot thickens. Or maybe it doesn't and I am just overreacting!\n\nEDIT: Jfc my inbox is blowing up lol. Sorry if i don't get to your questions I probably missed them cuz i have like fifty notifications!\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I found dead crows near Washtenaw Court and Geddes yesterday!\n\nA: Yes, thanks! We got them already and they are in my freezer (aka my porch, the Michigan freezer)\n\nQ: Does this have to do with the avian flu??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Have they been poisoned??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Where can I see the crows roost/fly in to roost?\n\nA: They roost in different spots every year. This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year. And DEFINITELY don't do this if you have outdoor poultry of any kind.

Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.

When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date).

My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late.

I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence.

Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment.

In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.\n\nWhat many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them.

The umich community is extremely homogenous and unwelcoming of minorities and low income students. \n\nAs someone who grew up in a very diverse community and went to a majority-minority high school, first coming to umich in 2019 was a shock. I\u2019m biracial, but white-passing, and the lack of diversity of this school is demoralizing. I was never used to seeing a sea of white people every day like this. Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes.

I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC.

Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45.

Why can\u2019t we have more buses running? Not even for days with exams for courses with thousands of students in the early morning? I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here. We NEED more buses. It is already quite disappointing when you visit your friends at Stockwell and get reminded we pay the same rent for Bursley and Baits. Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue. I want to stress I was at the bus stop for over an hour to get a bus. It was not because I was lazy and woke up late, but because I didn\u2019t want to push other students away to get on the bus and potentially make them late to their exam. \n\nWe need more buses in the morning.

We are afraid they might have been accidentally poisoned - crows are carrion eaters, so they'll occasionally eat a dead mouse or rat that was killed by rat poison, and then get poisoned themselves.\n\nPlease send me a DM if you find any recently-dead crows in the area, especially multiple in the same spot!\n\nThanks!\n\nPS Fun fact. Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year. During the day they split up and fly all around the county, and then return to roost at night. One of my favorite memories of being a student was watching the crows stream in as the sun began to set.\n\nUPDATE: Found three more just today - thank you to the redditor who messaged me about the third one!

This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year.

They are trying to keep this information quiet as they are worried about student backlash.\n\nWith the structure in the shape that parkEMU is claiming there is no current plan to fix or rebuild the structure or improve our parking conditions with employees saying \u201cyou can always use the north lot\u201d.\n\nParkEMU is on a daily campaign to make student commuters that didn\u2019t pay for their bloated prices pay in parking tickets and threats of vehicles being towed. ParkEMU claim that these vehicles are from people that live out in town and have no association with EMU but they know in truth they are only targeting students.\n\n\nEMU has sold the students out to these grifters and slumlords. Maybe we as students should blocking of staff parking or start parking in staff parking. Will they then understand that we shouldn\u2019t be paying $200 just to commute and park at their school and in these crappy conditions?", "Same as everyone else, I\u2019m sick of parking on campus. I cannot believe a major commuter school has this issue, but here we are. I\u2019m tired of fighting for parking spots and we all pay so much to have to deal with this. I\u2019m also tired of complaining and having nothing get done. \n\nIs there anything we could do to make campus more accessible for commuter students and staff? Where could we direct our complaints to? Are there outside forces we could contact to have help us?", "Remember when you see the administrators celebrate the construction of new buildings they are still letting a private company hold the student body hostage. Each semester parkEMU has raised the prices of commuter passes $10 since 2019. This semester it\u2019s almost $200 and then they closed down a third of our parking commuter parking while not opening the pay lots. We are being squeezed by an immoral company and the EMU administration is letting it happen.", "Is anyone else absolutely fucking fed up with this school?\n\nThe price is slightly lower than everyone else, so of course we expect somewhat of a sub-par college experience, commuter or not. \n\nHowever, it's really fucking embarrassing to say I go here: our parking system is ridiculous and unethical to students (more passes sold than spots available??? WHAT THE FUCK), the crime on campus is fucking insane, nothing gets fixed (what the fuck is going on with the dryers in every single bathroom on campus?????), our (non-STEM) classes tend to be pretty shitty (in my experience), the only consistently-available building to study comfortably in is the library (which closes at 10 on weekdays and 5 on weekends), there's zero fucking security (that overnight dorm door check-in system doesn't even happen every night), and--this is kinda petty--Sill hall, the newest on campus, has like 4 or 5 HUGE concrete platforms that are completely useless. \n\nLol, just had to vent.

No, more than likely you will be sent threatening emails by parkEMU to remind you that you are only allowed to park in in your second class student parking spots. ScrewU parkEMU.", "Can anyone give me a legitimate reason why the parking is $200 for 1 semester? Has the School given any reason why it went up $20 from last semester? I understand paying to park on campus and why paying gives some benefits but I feel like $200 for a pass that is only for 1 semester is kinda crazy.", "", "", "I'm under no illusions that I'm some sort of definitive expert on parking, the politics of higher education, or business.  I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)", "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on.

We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor. Such a case of  Tragedy of the Commons.\n\n Is this what I have to look forward to, when working on group projects at EMU with other students? \n\nLearned incompetence has not skipped generations,

Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.\n\nAddress these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.\n\nTry to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear.

I am an MSU employee offering a look at what I will argue is the beginning \u2013 or maybe mid-point \u2013 of a staffing crisis / implosion, as well as offering some ideas about the causes and how that will impact our community going forward (focusing on students in particular). I post here to bring awareness to this potential issue, and open a discussion with you all. I will only be sharing information that is already public, but this is a conversation that the university leadership is perhaps unwilling to have. Because this post got FAR longer than I originally intended, here are the key points:\n\n\\-Student service staffing was bad at MSU last year, causing many disruptions to student services\n\n\\-Conditions have only gotten worse since then\n\n\\-There are now around 800 current job vacancies at MSU combined with the largest entering class in the school\u2019s history\n\n\\-Administration\u2019s response has been to find temporary solutions, ignore the issue, or hire another highly paid admin to fix the issue through administrative efforts like \u201crestructuring\u201d (often shifting the workload to existing staff, causing even more staffing loss)\n\n\\-Conditions (e.g., delays or cancellation of essential services) for MSU students I believe are going to get much worse this year, unless the administration quickly improves the pay and working conditions of existing staff and stops the rapid bleed, while also significantly improving the job offers listed in order to actually replace staffing gaps\n\nFor the full post :)\n\n**Background:**\n\nIf you have paid even cursory attention to the economy and employment news over the past year, you will likely already know that there is a large-scale \u201cstaffing shortage\u201d across fields, as well as an ongoing potential collapse of key fields like healthcare/nursing, K-12 education/teachers, and many service industries. Not only are we living in a [mass-disabling event](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/15-of-us-worker-shortage-due-to-long-covid-study-says/), but whether there is a \u201cshortage of staff,\u201d really, or a shortage of fair pay and equitable working conditions in these fields is a good question. It is a broader question that I won\u2019t address here. The rapid spike in unionization across industries \u2013 from Starbucks, to Amazon, to [Chipotle nearby in Lansing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/25/chipotle-union-victory-fastfood-michigan/) \\- and collective action to combat employers is one sign that there are staff available for these jobs, but these workers are collectively protesting being exploited and underpaid. For a related institution in Lansing that is imploding, and for related reasons to MSU as I will argue, see this post about Sparrow Hospital: [https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow\\_is\\_imploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/wwqveu/sparrow_is_imploding/)\n\n**MSU\u2019s staffing implosion in sum:**\n\nI am defining a staffing implosion as an institutional event where there is an inability to fill staff vacancies that are essential to the function of that institution, thus compromising the functions of that institution. Not only is this currently occurring at MSU, but something even more critical to collapse is occurring: The staffing vacancies are creating a feedback loop. The more gaps that exist in essential staffing at the university, the more that workload is put onto the responsibilities of current staff. For every essential staff vacancy, a current staff member is then performing up to the job of one additional person. In addition to being felt as exploitative, this leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, which leads to further staff vacancies: a snowballing feedback loop that, if unchecked, will lead to institutional malfunctioning when enough essential tasks can no longer be completed.\n\n**Signs of the staffing implosion:**\n\nWarning signs of a staffing implosion reached major news outlets last Fall, [when MSU leadership asked faculty and academic staff to \u201cvolunteer\u201d to fill critical staffing gaps in the dining halls](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/10/20/msu-asking-faculty-volunteer-dining-halls-amid-staffing-shortage/8538013002/). Tellingly, this \u201crequest\u201d was sent by MSU leadership not first to the professors at-large, but to the Deans, Chairs, and Directors \u2013 in other words, if you are faculty, it was sent to your boss: the people responsible for your tenure, promotion, and working conditions. While most scoffed at this attempt at being \u201cvolun-told,\u201d others did not have such workplace protections. As reported, MSU also started requiring other staff to devote 8 hours per week to staff dining halls during key times (i.e., holidays).\n\nA variety of other staffing issues impacted MSU throughout the year, from a [shortage of bus drivers leading to reduced routes on campus](https://news.jrn.msu.edu/2022/02/cata-reduces-campus-services-because-of-driver-shortages/), a [general shortage of student workers](https://www.diverseeducation.com/news-roundup/article/15280311/with-student-worker-shortages-michigan-state-university-asks-faculty-staff-to-volunteer-in-dining-halls), but much, much more has been occurring that is public but not getting news coverage just yet. You can see evidence for the continued staffing issues by browsing the frequent issues raised on this subreddit: From difficulty getting an [appointment with advisors,](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wxo5ox/how_do_i_know_who_my_academic_advisor_is/) [to inability to get ahold of financial aid to resolve delays](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/wvnoad/late_student_loans_anyone/), to [delays in getting diplomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/ww6sgt/still_no_diploma/), and the list goes on. The behind-the-scenes problem is the same: Lack of staff, and incredibly overworked current employees. We are tired, and we are (increasingly) poor.\n\nThis slow-moving implosion is perhaps about to rapidly speed up as we are just days from the start of the fall semester: [There are currently around 800 job postings at MSU](https://careers.msu.edu/en-us/listing/), and some have been posted multiple times without success. In my unit alone, we are at half capacity compared with two years ago. In my broader unit, we\u2019ve lost three essential people in the last months of summer \u2013 and instead of urgently replacing them, the push from this area\u2019s leadership has been to \u201crestructure,\u201d i.e., redistribute those responsibilities to the remaining, overworked, underpaid staff. [Combined with a record number of entering students](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2022/08/24/michigan-state-expecting-the-largest-freshmen-class-on-record/65417567007/), we are likely in for a worsening staffing crisis at MSU in the coming semester.\n\n**What is causing the staffing implosion? Poor pay, terrible working conditions, and extreme administrative bloat combined with a lack of leadership?**\n\nSigns that MSU was failing in responding to the staffing implosion were present even in their first response of asking faculty to volunteer to cook (especially ironic not only because faculty here have PhDs not in culinary arts, but in fields like economics, biology, computer science, and so on, and could easily double their salary by leaving academia and working in their respective industry \u2013 but ironic also because some faculty here are *so* underpaid they could likely go make more per hour in some food service jobs. Shout out to the humanities instructors who bartend on the side for much better pay, you deserve better).\n\nYet looking at MSU\u2019s current response to staffing shortages is telling for just how poorly they are handling the implosion, and just how bad things are going to get. Let\u2019s take the shortage of academic advisors as a case study: Advisors are MSU employees currently outside of union protection, part of the \u201cacademic specialist\u201d employment category and often on fixed-term contracts. This means their job role can be re-written every year if they want to be rehired, and a portion of their job will always be \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d With the staffing shortage across campus, advisors are one area of staff whose workload has rapidly expanded. Advisor caseloads have exploded, but so have their \u201cextra\u201d duties that used to be done by support staff.\n\nTo \u201cfix\u201d this, MSU has created a new high-level administrator role and started a total restructuring of advising. The new structure has come top-down from the administration and public details are vague, but what is known is that first and second year students will be assigned a general advisor as part of a \u201cpathway\u201d (and potentially assigned a general area major rather than specific department major?) and then only(?) in their third year will students be handed off to an advisor in their major. These new \u201cpathway advisors\u201d will apparently not need a master\u2019s degree or background in higher education (in order to facilitate hiring), and without any background in the myriad of departments they will be advising for.\n\nThis \u201csolution\u201d to a staffing crisis was some over-paid admin\u2019s resume building dream that shows no sign of solving the real problem: Improving the staffing and workload of advisors we currently have in order for students to get accessible, timely, and high-quality information about their degree path of choice, and hiring new and highly qualified advisors to fill key vacancies. This case study is not unique, and similar \u201csolutions\u201d are being undertaken across the range of job positions.\n\nIn sum,\n\n**The university leadership has consistently shown that they will prioritize temporary solutions - like calls for staff \"volunteering \" - or hiring another overpaid administrator to \u201crestructure\u201d - rather than solving the real issues of essential staffing gaps for the people who actually interact with students. Combined with poor pay and working conditions that are causing experienced staff to leave for the many open jobs elsewhere, this is heightening a staffing crisis going into fall.**\n\nFinally, what can students do to fix these issues?\n\nI actually have no idea, that is why I am posting here. All I know is that students deserve better, and deserve to have the services and the education promised to them reliably provided. If I were the MSU president, I would make tuition free of charge (because in my view NO ONE should pay for essential public goods like education) and the university would fire me or go bankrupt within a year, so this is probably why I am not in a position at MSU that has any power whatsoever and can\u2019t give you any answers here. But y\u2019all are smart and collectively you are more powerful than every faculty and staff member combined, so if you think you deserve better than what MSU ends up offering you this upcoming year, then all I can say is: Demand equity for ALL workers at MSU until you get it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add this, but also: be good to one another this fall, and good to the staff workers at MSU. As you can see, we are under a lot of pressure and not getting much support from admin, but trying our best to support students. Everything is likely gonna take longer and it might get really stressful as a student. <3 ", "", "", "", "Just wanna say a shout out to all the service staff and essential workers at msu who have had to continue working every day through this tragedy.

I WOULD have been in the union any other monday but last night I wasn\u2019t, nothing bad happened.  So why am I so upset?  Why am I taking this so hard? I\u2019m fine. Literally perfectly unharmed.  Yet here I am, barely functioning. I feel this overwhelming guilt that I\u2019m acting like this when there are kids who WERE traumatized, hurt, and killed.  I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying all of this, I just think I needed to get it out to people who might understand.  Every moment I\u2019m not crying or shut down, I\u2019m guilty for not grieving for my community.  Every time I am grieving for those lost, I feel guilty because I never even knew them.  When I get those weird intrusive thoughts of me getting hurt in the Union, I feel guilty because I was lucky that I never got hurt.

The dog went after me instead. \n\nHey all. I wanted to share my story of being attacked by a pit bull on Thursday July 28, at 10pm, at the intersection of Main St and Huron.  \n\n2 of my friends, my girlfriend, and I were walking to bars downtown on Thursday night around 10pm when we saw a homeless lady on Huron about 70 yards away from us screaming for someone to call 911. We all stopped to try and understand what was going on. We looked at her and saw she was walking towards us holding a large, muscular, white pitbull on a leash. After about 10 seconds, a homeless man who was walking away from her walked past us and told our group \u201cdon\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s crazy and that dog has bitten like 5 people\u201d. \n\nOur group and the homeless man started walking away from the intersection (moving south down main st) while watching the lady and her dog. She followed us until she reached the intersection of Huron and Main St. At that point she let go of the leash of the pit bull and yelled \u201cget them!\u201d. The dog immediately started sprinting towards us. \n\nMy group of 4 and the homeless man were all on the sidewalk. The homeless man and myself were closer to the road. I could tell immediately that the dog was running straight for me. I believe the dog was supposed to attack the homeless man, but instead it mixed us up and went after me instead. I think it\u2019s because both the homeless man and myself have dark skin, while the rest of the group had light skin. I\u2019m not sure though. \n\nIn any case, the moment I knew the dog was chasing after me, I immediately started sprinting away. The dog was running at us moving south on Main st. I decided to run past it, go north on Main st, and turn left to go west on Huron. \n\nI ran for about 10 seconds as fast as I could before tripping while transitioning from the sidewalk to the road. I hit the ground very hard and skinned my legs and my right elbow. Immediately, the dog was on me. It was scratching and biting me while I was on the floor rolling around, screaming for help, and kicking at it trying to survive. While this was occurring the lady who owns the dog was standing nearby laughing. \n\nI ended up sustaining multiple physical injuries. Both of my knees were skinned in multiple places. My shins were roughed up from the road. My elbow was cut up and skinned badly. Both hips have scratches and bruises. My left thumb has a cut. My right knuckles are cut up. Both palms are roughed up. I have 3 dog scratches on my back near my neck, and 1 on my stomach. My shoulders are both very bruised from the impact of rolling around on the street. And finally I have a large bite mark on my lower back.\n\nMy group and I were also very shaken up mentally. Some of us will probably need to go to therapy in order to work through what happened. It\u2018s scary to be literally hunted down by an attack dog. And it\u2019s scary to watch helplessly as someone you love is being attacked. \n\nLuckily, a man who was wearing full motorcycle gear (boots, leather pants, leather jacket, and helmet) sprinted after the dog the moment he saw it attacking me. I didn\u2019t see exactly what occurred but according to my group he tackled the dog and restrained it. \n\nThe moment I was free, my group ran south down Main St to get away. I had lost a shoe and my shirt was torn. I was bleeding profusely as well from multiple areas. We went into a bar and I quickly got bandaged up. \n\nThere were police and ambulances already in the area from some other incident. As we were leaving the bar, we saw 2 police officers talking to the lady while she was holding her dog on a leash. We wanted to approach and talk to them, but the dog was completely unrestrained. We were afraid if we got too close the dog would recognize me and attack again. And we weren\u2019t confident that the lady would/could prevent the dog from doing that.\n\nI spoke with 1 police officer we ran into as we left the scene and told her everything that happened. After that, I was driven to the ER by a friend of mine to get treated.\n\nWe are in the process of talking to the Ann Arbor Police Department, the Huron Valley Humane Society, and a couple other places. \n\nHowever, no action has been taken yet against the lady and her dog. The lady is clearly unfit to be in public, much less to be in possession of an attack dog. We watched as she let go of the dog\u2019s leash and yelled at it to attack us. And she was laughing out loud as I was being attacked in the middle of the road. She was not arrested and is still roaming the streets of Ann Arbor. The dog was released from the Huron Valley Humane Society shelter the same day it was admitted. It was then taken to the lady\u2019s mother\u2019s house to quarantine for 10 days. \n\nThere is currently nothing stopping the lady and her dog from roaming the streets again in 10 days and attacking some random passerby. \n\nMy girlfriend reached out to Mlive last week but we have not gotten a response and so I wanted to share my story here to inform everyone. It\u2019s crazy that someone can get attacked like this in downtown Ann Arbor and no one knows about it because it hasn\u2019t been reported anywhere. \n\nPlease be alert and cautious as you walk around.

When I started at UM Dearborn and UM Flint in 2015, I was making $28,000 teaching full time.  By the time I left UM in the Summer or 2022 I was making $43000 teaching full time.  This is a very large increase- over 60%!  Don't take my word for it- my salary info is public and can be seen here:  \n\n\n[https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R](https://www.umsalary.info/peoplesearch.php?LName=Toth&FName=Steven+R)  \n\n\nI can owe this increase in salary to the LEO union that I was a proud member of during my time at UM.  During contract negotiations, LEO made salaries a priority and levied an incredible strike threat to force the administration to increase our salaries.  During the time of the most recent LEO negotiations, I was the chair of the LEO union at UM Flint and a member of the strike team- the group created to put pressure on the administration in the form of public actions.  We organized a lot during this period and really had strong shows of public unity and strength.  Members of other unions- including GEO!- came out and support LEO in a huge way, and the administration caved into our biggest demand: **Pay parity for lecturers across all three campuses.**  That's right, starting in 2023, all three campuses will have the same starting salary for lecturers, which is $51000 (a HUGE increase from my starting salary at UM Dearborn of $28000).  This win was incredible.  I remember when I first started HR said that UM Flint and UM Dearborn lecturers would never be paid the same at UM Ann Arbor Lecs!  However, LEO organized, had a lot of help for its allies, and really forced UM to increase salaries to a fair and equitiable wage.  If you would've told me that as a lecturer in 2015 that my salary would effectively double by 2023 I would not have believed you.  That, however is the power of the union and collective action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always get what you are willing to fight for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful to the LEO Union members for always fighting for me and fighting for a salary that truly made me a better teacher.  As my salary increased, my stress decreased, I could quit my second job(s), and I could get reliable transportation.  I literally would teach a 200 person Gen Chem class and then go to Barnes & Noble and work as a supervisor.  I am so grateful for the other Union members like GEO who supported LEO during these events as well.  I support GEO and their strike and I hope they send a strong message to the administration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I am now a \"lecturer equivalent\" at Washtenaw Community College.  Again, since you can look up my salary I will just tell you- it's $84000.  The Univeristy of Michigan has the third largest endownment of any public college at 17.3 **billion** dollars.  The endownment at Washtenaw Community College is significantly less at 20 **million** dollars.  Tuition at WCC is also significantly less per credit hour.  If you believe the story that \"there just is no money at UM and that's why the salaries have to be so low\" you are buying right into the administration's narrative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPPS: My time at UM was an absolute joy.  I loved it, and I loved the students.  I taught at all three campuses.  This was truly one of the happiest times of my life.  I also think I did a good job and had a pretty good reputation, but that is certainly up to the students and not to me.  The only reason I left UM was because of the WCC salary offer.  I get that \"money isn't everything\" or whatever but it sure does help.  If UM could've matched my WCC salary I may still be there.  Good salaries retain top talent.

It makes a mess and gets tracked everywhere (see #1)\n3. It gets into drainage systems (sewers) and ends up dumped in the Huron River\n3a. The plastic degrades in the river, and we end up with yummy microplastics in our water which never dissipate\n3b. Microplastics are already decimating marine ecosystems, and this makes it worse\n4. Confetti/glitter is not a healthy snack for animals, and if they eat enough, it can cause animals to starve because of internal blockages\n4a.

Hope this helps!\n\nPrior to Going Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Have a fully charged phone\n\ud83d\udd39Apps: Download and set up Uber and Venmo. Make sure to put in your payment information so you don\u2019t have to deal with that in a non-sober state.\n\ud83d\udd38Cards: I don\u2019t recommend bringing your credit or debit card because you might drop it and it\u2019s a whole hassle. Bring your room key and Mcard. Put these in a safe place (I recommend the back of your phone)\n\ud83d\udd39Stay Connected: Make sure to turn on Find My IPhone and give your location to trusted friends. Also make sure to get their locations too. And I know this is obvious but get the numbers or snaps of everyone in the group. \n\ud83d\udd38Money: I usually carry $5-10 for if I get hungry. Another option is setting up Apple Pay\n\nGoing Out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Go in a group: Bring friends!! Never go out alone, it\u2019s less fun and super dangerous. Remember ladies, you go together and you leave together.\n\ud83d\udd38Buddy system: Within your group you should always have a buddy. Y\u2019all should be attached at the hip. If she goes to the bathroom, you go to the bathroom. If you go to the bar, she comes with. \n\n\n\nApparel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39Tops: I typically wear a slutty crop top. Don\u2019t spend too much on these because frats are pretty dirty and drinks tend to spill. Also if your top has sleeves make sure it\u2019s dark to avoid pit stains \n\ud83d\udd38Bottoms: Any old pair of jeans will work.  Again make sure it\u2019s a pair you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Remember that you may want to get on platforms to be wary of skirts and dresses (wear shorts underneath)\n\ud83d\udd39Shoes: Do not wear heels, I cannot stress that enough. Frat floors tend to be dirty, sticky and/or wet. Most girls des\u00edgnate an old pair of sneakers as their frat shoes and wear those on nights out. Also due to the distance of each frat, nights out tend to be very walking heavy so keep that in mind. When the snow starts, consider switching to frat snow boots. It\u2019s safer and also no one looks at your feet so wear whatever you want.\n\ud83d\udd38Outerwear: Because this is Michigan, it\u2019s gonna get pretty cold. Getting pneumonia and frostbite are real dangers, so please wear a jacket. Like the shoes, most girls designate a special jacket as their frat jacket or \u201cfracket\u201d. Make sure it\u2019s an old jacket or a super cheap jacket. Going to a thrift store is a great option to shop for a fracket. Unfortunately, fracket theft is super common so don\u2019t spend a ton of money on this. Tip: If you go in a group, tie all the jacket sleeves together. People are less likely to steal it if it\u2019s a big ol\u2019 jacket rope.\n\ud83d\udd39Accessories: Always a fun way to dress an outfit up. Don\u2019t bring a purse or wallet, it\u2019s a nuisance. Also they always get lost. I recommend a phone case with a wallet. Use this to put your room key and some cash. \n\ud83d\udd38Makeup: I really don\u2019t have any tips for this one. But feel free to experiment with new looks. Also theme makeup is pretty fun\n\ud83d\udd39Hair: No matter what always bring a hair tie. Getting sweaty is inevitable, so be prepared. \n\ud83d\udd38Glasses: If you can wear contacts, wear contacts. If you can\u2019t, use anti-fog wipes.\n\n\nDrinking\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Im not saying I support underage drinking but if you\u2019re going to do it please be safe about it.\n\ud83d\udd39Start slow- Since it\u2019s a new environment and many of you lack experience, start slow and really pay attention to how your reacting. Tolerance varies from person to person, so make sure you pay attention to how YOU\u2019RE feeling. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t exceed more than 4 because it\u2019s all so new.\n\ud83d\udd38Drinks- Always get your own drinks. I recommend canned drinks like Trulys or Beers because you open them yourselves and it\u2019s much safer in my opinion. If you choose to get a mixed drink, make sure to watch the cup at all times. Do not leave your cup unattended!!\n\ud83d\udd39Open bars: Most frats have open bars available to pretty much everyone. There\u2019s usually a \u201cbartender\u201d whose I\u2019m charge of dispensing drinks. If you\u2019re feeling drunk, please ask for a water. Most frats have them. If the bar is fully open and left without a bartender be very very careful getting drinks. Last year, there was a huge roofie-ing incident at one of the major frats because the bar was completely open.\n\ud83d\udd38\ud83d\udd38Medical Amnesty: Michigan has medical amnesty. This basically means that if you\u2019re intoxicated and need medical attention, the hospital won\u2019t snitch on you for drinking. Alcohol poisoning is real and very dangerous. \n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39Alcohol poisoning: Some signs of this are blacking out, unconsciousness, vomiting and seizures. Please go to the nearest hospital if you or your friend is experiencing severe symptoms.\n\ud83d\udd38Side tip: If you loose your friends and aren\u2019t feeling well, just go up to the nearest group of girls and tell them you need help. There\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ll help you either get an Uber home or reunite with friends. Girls help girls, period.\n\nHookups\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Unfortunately, I\u2019m a serial relationship-ist. So I don\u2019t have much experience in this category.\n\ud83d\udd39Use protection: Do not leave this up to the man. Always use a condom. And please consider other birth control options. I\u2019ve had a pretty great experience with birth control pills. But it\u2019s different for everyone, so do your research \n\ud83d\udd38Consent: If your drunk, you can\u2019t give consent. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t do anything you aren\u2019t 100% comfortable with. \n\ud83d\udd39Also don\u2019t fall in love with a frat boy, they\u2019re all whores\n\nAfter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd38Hunger: Ann Arbor has many places open after hours. Fan favorites are Joe\u2019s Pizza, NYPD, Insomnia cookies, AND Pancheros\n\ud83d\udd39Sleeping: If I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, I usually prop my head up with a few pillows and sleep on my side. Although I haven\u2019t experienced it, throwing up in your sleep is possible and you need to be prepared. The real risk here is choking on your own vomit in your sleep. \n\ud83d\udd38Morning After: Drink a Gatorade or Pedialyte. Dehydration is a bitch\n\n\nNew! Community Additions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\ud83d\udd39It\u2019s okay to leave: If at any point you\u2019re not feeling comfortable, just know it\u2019s 100% okay to leave. Call an Uber and call it a night. There are parties every weekend, going home early isn\u2019t a big deal. Your comfort and safety comes first.\n\ud83d\udd38Don\u2019t vandalize frats: Remember people live there too. Be respectful of the property and don\u2019t walk into random rooms. Also this could get you kicked out or even blacklisted from attending future parties.\n\ud83d\udd39Make friends with the people in your dorm: You never know when you might need help coming home and seeing a familiar face is such a relief. Also it\u2019s no extra hassle for them because they\u2019re going the same way anyways.\n\ud83d\udd38Eat before going out!

Furthermore, I have not seen any results of the efforts the administration have been trying to implement to improve diversity my past four years here.\n\nThe UM student body is a bubble vastly different from the real world. And not just in racial ways. $154k is the average household income of a UM student. 66% of our students come the top 20% income percentile. I don\u2019t know if any other low income students feel this too, but this income divide really makes me feel out of place here. I can\u2019t afford a Canada Goose, nor designer clothes. Most of the clothes I have are the same since freshmen year. I just don\u2019t know how to \u201cfind my people\u201d when everyone I see is white and rich.

I see a lot of people talk about both on this subreddit and in general that the Michigan community is strong and everyone can find their group. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everyone. \n\nLastly, I wanted to call out the organization that let me down the most in trying to find a community\u2026the ICC. I can whole heartedly say that, as a whole, the ICC community (at least central campus co-ops) consist of the most homogenous, racist, and unwelcoming people I\u2019ve met. Yes, they\u2019re very accepting in lots of different ways\u2026but certainly not race. I also was stunned at the amount of rich co-opers.

Waiting on the bench for 30 minutes and the first bus comes full with students from Baits. The next bus came at 7:30 with students enough to fill two buses waiting at Bursley stop alone. By this point a lot of people just left to get a scooter or drive themselves with friends to get down to central so lucky I could get on the next bus 7:45.

I jokingly blame the fact that I live on north that I miss some points, but I now think if we run some statistics students on north will have a slightly lower avg for the sole reason that we live here.

Affecting our academic performance directly and indirectly ( Having to be late to exam, potentially failing the exam if the professor is not too understanding enough, having to wake up earlier and sacrifice having breakfast) is a serious issue.

Ann Arbor's murder of crows is one of the largest murders in Michigan. They do communal roosting behavior during the winter which is why you see them in such massive flocks this time of year.

We got them already and they are in my freezer (aka my porch, the Michigan freezer)\n\nQ: Does this have to do with the avian flu??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Have they been poisoned??\n\nA: We won't know until the test results come back!\n\nQ: Where can I see the crows roost/fly in to roost?\n\nA: They roost in different spots every year. This year they picked Washtenaw Court/Geddes Ave area. Other years, they've roosted in the Forest St Cemetery, the Diag, the athletic campus, and other spots. Best place to see them fly in (a pretty cool sight of thousands of crows streaming across town) is anywhere a) flat or b) high up near downtown A2. I've seen them on I94 near stone school, at stadium near eisenhower, Varsity Drive area, the A2 airport, etc.\n\n Q: Is the bird flu still a thing?\n\nA: Sort of! HPAI has died down a bit as many birds have flown south. But I would strongly strongly encourage people to not be feeding wild birds or giving them water this year. And DEFINITELY don't do this if you have outdoor poultry of any kind.

I also am not sure exactly how I can be useful on the ground in changing the situation in regards to the parking crisis, or the broader issues at EMU that it is symbolic of.  But damn it, I love Eastern Michigan.  Specifically I love the people that made that space a place for me to become a better version of myself than when I arrived, and I want that to be the experience for everyone who chooses to go there.  Shoutout to everyone on here who has already contributed to the discourse.  I know there've been disagreements about the best course of action going forward, but trying multiple strategies might be what it takes to make progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boycott**\n\nPragmatically the best way to punish ParkEMU, LAZ, Provident, and their mishmash of holding companies is attacking them financially.  That's the reason the garage is closed, restrict supply of parking spots, and squeeze more money out of people they'd otherwise only get money from when they're buying a permit. Every empty pay lot spot is losing them money, and in the wake of a year + of virtual learning, I imagine their financial situation was not satisfactory to the folks at the top of the food chain.  If everyone with a permit parked in a permit lot, the only money they make daily is off visitors to campus, a much less reliable income stream than students and staff.  The biggest obstacle to boycotting pay lots is distance.  Campus is surrounded on two sides by residential neighborhoods, one side by a business district, and the other side by an active railroad and the Huron River.  I've researched the City of Ypsilanti's maps for West Cross St Business District Parking, Residential Permit Parking, and Google Street View over the past few days.  My first conclusion was that the Residential Permit system is deliberately designed to keep students from parking in College Heights, Normal Park, and especially in Depot Town west of the River.  Considering the size of the campus it makes sense that any plan should include parking in as many different directions as possible.  To the North of Campus, I can't verify these options work but it might be useful to check out Eastern Plaza and parking on Railroad St.  To the East of campus, Frog Island Park is a definitively viable option, but there is street parking on Washington St. between Huron and Cross as well as on Huron between Cross and Washington as well.  To the South of campus there aren't any options unless you want to risk a ticket, Hiawatha doesn't seem to have any restrictions, and Sherman is 90 minutes from 8-4.  West of campus things get easier I suppose.   Permit restrictions here only run one block into College Heights from Oakwood, and Gregory between Louise and Cornell looks to be ok on the permit map but I can't verify if street parking is allowed.  I didn't do any research into whether there are pay lots off campus that are cheaper (probably not).  None of these are great options in terms of location in comparison to where people need to go, and it needs to be acknowledged that this is biggest obstacle to a boycott.  However, boycotts are never particularly convenient for anyone, and taking these extra steps is a demonstration in and of itself of how fed up people are.  This course of action would be more effective with the organizing of carpools, as well as communication about when commuter lots are full and which areas off campus still have available parking.  Putting the financial squeeze on ParkEMU is certainly going to get the attention of its ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protest**\n\nI don't believe that protesting and boycotting are exclusive options, doing both is going to have more impact than either would alone.  I also don't believe that the issue is ParkEMU employees FWIW. they're just pawns of the investment firm that runs the whole thing and I doubt their higher ups give a shit about them.  The way I see it is that Provident would probably use destruction of equipment or harassment of employees to either get the University to crack down on student protests or to use against EMU in any legal proceedings.  The University has issued a Notice of Default against Provident for the way they've handled the garage. Considering admin / BoR stances on their private partners in the past, the fact that there was a public statement critical of Provident is a sign of possibility to achieve movement.  I would hope there's a possibility that public figures and members of the community in Ypsilanti will side with students in this fight too, considering the reaction of some Councilors when EMU initially sought to privatize parking, it's not out of the question.  But the signal will be students (and possibly staff) taking action on the ground, and holding some feet to the fire.  There are by in large part two ways to solve most social issues (which let's be clear this is) money, and community.  There needs to be a sign that we have enough community at Eastern that it's force to be reckoned with.  I have immense pride in my alma mater, I know that's not exactly common (some might say it's foolish), and if you view your time at EMU as a transactional experience that's fine too.  Hell, part of what was so great about going there (transferring in as a 23 year old Junior mind you) was the variety of college experiences everyone was having in the same place.  But like I said at the beginning it was the experiences, the people, and the lessons I learned that make this place special to me, not the parking contractors or administrators.  That personal investment in this place (which happens to occupy a certain space) that each of us makes is not only what makes it important to me, but also what will hopefully lead to change.  This school has made too many bad decisions in the name of money, a plight that is hardly unique to here, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  Maybe they can blame it on budget issues.  But hey, I think the State of Michigan needs to spend more of my tax dollars on education too.  Regardless, these decisions impact us, so it is on us to fight them.  We as a community have to say we are tired of the folks who are putting education first being sold out by those who want to squeeze every dime out of this space they can.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that this is all at least somewhat helpful in solving this.  Good luck, and Go Green.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the links to the maps I mentioned earlier:\n\n[Residential Permit Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3716/Residential-Parking-Map-and-Street-List_2022-08-18?bidId=)\n\n[West Cross Map](https://cityofypsilanti.com/DocumentCenter/View/3220/westcross-parking-2021-11-29)", "I know Yp is pretty herb friendly, personally, I don't mind if you do it outside away from the entrances where people don't usually go, but come on.

How dare a private company force you to not have the ability to safely park within the campus lots because you can\u2019t pay for their extra fees even though you already paid for the tuition and fees from EMU. How dare EMU let this injustice occur and allow a private company to divide its student body into 2nd and 3rd class citizens.\n\nThe main people who are oppressing you during this whole situation are the parkEMU attendants. These grown men are not part of EMU and have no affiliation with the school other than their employers cheekily named them parkEMU.

We had less than a week to put it together, a 3 to 4 page paper and up to 50 minutes of oral presentation. When the assignment was given and assigned, we had less than 6 days to complete the presentation and paper. We only had one class after the project was assigned to bring up issues to the professor. One of the group members was assigned after the project groups had already formed. Neither one of the group members have good attendance, one was not there on Thursday when the project was assigned, the second was not there the Tuesday(day before the due date). Due to scheduling conflicts, we were only able to get together on one day, which was when the paper was due at Midnight. Before our meeting to write the paper, during this time we had communicated via text. My other group members did not want fully cover all the points in the assignment group project the professor had clearly stated in the  syllabus. I did mention we need to cover these topics and they brushed it off. After we finished up at the library on Wednesday night, one of my group members said they were going to turn in the paper. I didn't offer because I had already reserved library group study rooms and I was completing the PowerPoint slides for the project. Well the group member ended up turning in the paper late. We ended up getting a C on the group project, it dropped my  A to a B.  I really wanted to get an A in this class, to apply to scholarships, and now I will not be able to apply to certain scholarships, due to my group partners incompetence. I had two group partners who were not as motivated/irresponsible to earn a good grade on this project. I have never have worked on a project like this with such unmotivated/,irresponsible group members. I just found out today, that the paper was turned in late, from a text message. Side note other groups that picked their topics depending on the date have up to 5 weeks to complete the assignment. It would be a better policy to give each group the same amount of time, if the last group had 6 weeks to prepare, versus the first group only had 4 days, second group had 6 days. Students do have other courses and assignments have been on the calendar for weeks. \nThe assignment was not a fair distribution of time to complete the project. In the past most of my other professors give more than enough time for group projects to be completed. Not this course/professor.
