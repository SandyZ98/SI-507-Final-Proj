    "Post Text": "So I noticed that wayne state has. a special program for freshmen if you live on campus but since I’m not going to be living on campus I feel like Im gonna miss out on a ton. There was a scholarship avalible but I missed it (Im very last minute on stuff its a bad trait) and now I’m worried about how college will go. I’m pretty shy and don’t really have a lot of close friends in high school so I was hoping that college would be better but idk.",

I tried to find an outline on the general education courses but all I know is that I need 35 credits of general education. It's so confusing bc I need to fit 35 credits worth of composition, oral communication, quantitative classes, cultural studies, and my own major all into one year. I'm struggling to even search for classes bc they don't show up. I'm trying to make a plan but I have no idea if my plan will get me enough credits to pass",

I'm now working abroad and my new job needs my diploma ASAP, but talking to the service center is useless. Any ideas about who else I can talk to, short of shaming Wayne State on social media?",
